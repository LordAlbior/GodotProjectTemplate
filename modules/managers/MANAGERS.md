# Managers

This folder is intended to hold manager systems. These system aim to manage game resources, behavior and objects needed for the gameplay. Managers tend to be highly configurable and generic. For example, an enemy manager could be responsible for taking care of the behavior of enemies spawn and lifecycle. Be aware that a explosion in the number of manager scenes is a code smell.
