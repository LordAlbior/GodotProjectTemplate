# Godot Project Template

This project template is an effort to create a organization for my future Godot projects. The structure is a balance of several best practices advised by active members of the Godot community. Be aware that this is not a silver-bullet solution and may be too much for simple games and too little for larger projects.

This project comes with some addons loaded:

* Color Preview
* Godot Copilot
* Easy Velocity Vector Display
* GUT
* Kanban Tasks
* Super Spector
* Todo Manager

Fell free to unload and delete this folder if you don't want to use these addons.

As a last step, remember to edit the project.godot file to change the name of the project before starting you game development journey.

If you are using this small project of mine, I wish you good luck and awesome games in your future.

## License

The addons have their own licenses that can be look at in their respective folders. This small project is under Unlicense. So feel free to do whatever you want. It is not my business anyway ;)
